1.100 - a total rewrite
        new feature: boolean queries
        known regressions:
           + unacceptably slow search in full paragraph
           + no -Ffoo,bar,baz (equivalent boolean q available)
           + no internationalization

1.11 - added the -s option

1.10 - made -c synonymous with --count

1.7 - allowed several -F options and comma-separated list of
      fields as -F's argument

1.6 - disabled the -c option

1.3 - fixed a segfault related to the -c option
      deprecated the short -c option (use the long option instead)

1.2 - added the -v option (see manpage for details)
      New documentation file Compatibility.

1.0 - no news is good news
