grep-dctrl is a command-line tool for searching and manipulating
certain Debian-specific files.  It's not much use on other systems,
but it should still compile on a non-Debian system.  You need Lars
Wirzenius' publib library to compile it (you should be able to find it
from the Debian distribution or at http://www.iki.fi/liw/programs/).
