Things left to be done on grep-dctrl:
   * Write a good Texinfo manual.
   * Do translations of the messages to other languages
   * Fix any bugs.
   * Add requested features (see 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?which=pkg&data=grep-dctrl&sev-inc=wishlist
     )

Some additional features that would be useful:
    * a frontend accepting a SQL-like query language
    * expr-dctrl for arithmetic et al

If you want to help with one of these (or you have some other ideas
