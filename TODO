Things left to be done on grep-dctrl:
   * Write a good Texinfo manual.
   * Do translations of the messages to other languages
     (we now have Catalan, English and Finnish).
   * Fix any bugs.
   * Add requested features (see 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?which=pkg&data=grep-dctrl&sev-inc=wishlist
     )

If you want to help with one of these (or you have some other ideas
for grep-dctrl), contact <ajk@debian.org>.
