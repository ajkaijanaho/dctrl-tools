Description: Grep Debian package information
 The grep-dctrl program can answer such questions as
   * "What is the Debian package foo?"
   * "Which version of the Debian package bar is now current?"
   * "Which Debian packages does John Doe maintain?"
   * "Which Debian packages are somehow related to the Scheme
      programming language?"
 and with some help
   * "Who maintain the essential packages of a Debian system?"
 given a useful input file. 
 .
 It is a specialised grep program that is meant for processing any
 file which has the general format of a Debian package control file.
 These include the dpkg available file, the dpkg status file, and the
 Packages files on a distribution medium (such as a Debian CD-ROM or
 an FTP site carrying Debian).
 .
 This package includes the specializations grep-status, grep-available
 and grep-aptavail, which take their input by default from the dpkg
 status file, the dpkg available file (updated by dselect update, but
 see below) and the apt available database (updated by apt-get
 update), respectively.  The grep-available specialization is useful
 mainly to users of dselect or apt, while grep-aptavail only works if
 apt is installed.
 .
 A script, sync-available, which syncs the dpkg available file to the
 apt available database without requiring dselect, is included.
