Description: Command-line tools to process Debian package information
 Debian package information is generally stored in files having a
 special file format, dubbed the Debian control file format (the dctrl
 format), a special case of the record jar file format.  These tools
 operate on any files conforming in a general sense to that format and
 are therefore widely applicable whenever those formats are in play.
 .
 Included are:
 .
   grep-dctrl     - Grep dctrl-format files
   grep-available - Grep the DPKG available database
   grep-status    - Grep the DPKG status database
   grep-aptavail  - Grep the APT available database
 .
   sort-dctrl     - Sort dctrl-format files
 .
   tbl-dctrl      - Tabularize dctrl-format files
 . 
   sync-available - Sync the dpkg available database with
                    the apt database

Description: Grep Debian package information - transition package
 The grep-dctrl program is provided by the dctrl-tools package.  This
 package is available to ease the transition.  You can safely remove
 this package when no other package depends on it.
 .
 The grep-dctrl program can answer such questions as
   * "What is the Debian package foo?"
   * "Which version of the Debian package bar is now current?"
   * "Which Debian packages does John Doe maintain?"
   * "Which Debian packages are somehow related to the Scheme
      programming language?"
 and with some help
   * "Who maintain the essential packages of a Debian system?"
 given a useful input file. 
 .
 It is a specialised grep program that is meant for processing any
 file which has the general format of a Debian package control file.
 These include the dpkg available file, the dpkg status file, and the
 Packages files on a distribution medium (such as a Debian CD-ROM or
 an FTP site carrying Debian).
 .
 The specializations grep-status, grep-available and grep-aptavail,
 which take their input by default from the dpkg status file, the dpkg
 available file (updated by dselect update, but see below) and the apt
 available database (updated by apt-get update), respectively.  The
 grep-available specialization is useful mainly to users of dselect or
 apt, while grep-aptavail only works if apt is installed.
 .
 A script, sync-available, which syncs the dpkg available file to the
 apt available database without requiring dselect, is provided.
