Developers and users interested in the future of dctrl-tools
(grep-dctrl and friends) are encouraged to subscribe to the
dctrl-tools-devel mailing list at
  http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/dctrl-tools-devel

Early versions are available in the experimental distribution of
Debian.  Those and also occasional very early preview versions are
available at
  deb http://antti-juhani.kaijanaho.info/dctrl-tools-experimental/ ./
  deb-src http://antti-juhani.kaijanaho.info/dctrl-tools-experimental/ ./
I would appreciate if all users of these sources subscribed to the
above mailing list.
