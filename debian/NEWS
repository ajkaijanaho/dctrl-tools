grep-dctrl (1.103) unstable; urgency=low

    The annoying banner which was added in version 1.100 and which asked
    for testing has been removed.  The banner logic used the dotfile
    ~/.grep-dctrl-banner-shown, which can now be safely removed from all
    home directories.  The banner logic only ever existed in unstable; it
    was never in any version of grep-dctrl that was released with Debian
    stable.
  
    Grep-dctrl now adheres to the same exit value conventions as grep(1).
    It also supports grep's -q option.

grep-dctrl (1.100) unstable; urgency=low

    This version was a total rewrite of grep-dctrl.  This added several
    new features, made it run generally faster and, of course, added some
    bugs and regressions.
  
    The big new feature is support for boolean queries.  The new feature
    allows combining searches arbitrarily using propositional connectives
    (and, or and not).  The command line syntax has been extended to
    support this feature, but all old invocations work the same (modulo
    bugs and regressions).  See the manual page for more information.
  
    There are also several known regressions (presented here in order
    of severity):
      - The -Ffoo,bar,baz feature that allows searching in multiple fields
      is not supported.  However, this is not that bad, as the same effect
      can be obtained by using the new boolean query syntax (ie. instead of
      saying -FPackage,Description foo, say -FPackage foo -o -FDescription
      foo).
    - There is no longer any internationalization support and hence no
      translations of messages.
  
    This version added an annoying banner asking for testing.  It has been
    later removed.
