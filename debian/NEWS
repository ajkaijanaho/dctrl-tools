grep-dctrl (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

    This entry describes changes since the last version in stable, 1.9,
    released in July 2001.
  
    Grep-dctrl has been completely rewritten.  It is now faster than
    before, in some cases even an order of magnitude faster, and it is now
    much easier to add new features.
  
    Speaking of new features, the major addition since 1.9 is the ability
    to use the full descriptive power of propositional calculus to
    combining searches.  Basically, putting --and between two old-style
    searches combines them with AND, and --or does the same with OR.
    There is also a --not.  See the grep-dctrl(1) manual page for more
    information.
  
    The option -c now is synonymous with --count.
  
    There is a new -d switch that selects for display the _short description_
    (the first line of the "Description" field).
  
    Grep-dctrl now adheres to the same exit value conventions as grep(1).
    It also supports GNU grep's -q and --silent options.
