grep-dctrl (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of version.h.  The defines are now done on the
    compiler command line.  This will avoid the harmful rebuild of

    manpage gets rebuilt.
  * Clean off backup files on debian/rules clean.
  * rc.c: Search user's rcfile first.

    to informational.
  * Updated the Finnish translation.
  * Prettified the long description in debian/control.

    the level `informational' becomes much less verbose.
