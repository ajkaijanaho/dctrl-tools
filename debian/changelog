    in woody+1.

grep-dctrl (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control [Standards-Version]: 3.1.1
     + debian/control [Build-Depends]: Added
  * debian/control [Description]: Improved.

grep-dctrl (1.3a) frozen; urgency=low

  * matcher.c (find_field): Unroll the first iteration of the first loop
    and then remove the special-case p==s if in the loop body. 
    Closes: bug#59455.

 -- Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <ajk@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Mar 2000 14:21:41 +0200

grep-dctrl (1.3) frozen; urgency=low

  * grep-dctrl.c (main): Add a colon after c in getopt's
    argument, fixing the segfault in bug#57144.  This fix is meant
    for frozen and is minimal; I will upload a more complicated fix
    (but more correct in the long run) separately to unstable, since
    the better fix requires feature changes.
  * grep-dctrl.c (print_usage, main), grep-dctrl.1.cp, po/fi.po:
    Deprecated short option "-c" to allow its meaning to be changed later
    in woody.  Functionality is not changed in this version; only
    messages about the deprecation have been added. This must go to
    potato to allow a smooth transition to the better fix for bug#57144.
  * debian/copyright: Updated copyright years (added 2000).
  * debian/NEWS: documented this release's changes

grep-dctrl (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New major version.  No major changes, just polishing - we have
    been converging to 1.0 for some time now.
  * grep-dctrl.c (main): Don't allow -s to be used many times,
    as it does not work in the obvious way.
  * Updated the Finnish translation.

    Only README is not relevant to Debian users, so not installing it.

    use a default dummy version number if we don't.  This allows
    the package to build more easily on a non-Debian system.
  * Unsymlink things that had symlinks outside the source.
  * Added getopt source for the benefit of broken systems.
  * configure.in: Use /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL as a default for
    the copying file location.

grep-dctrl (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * matcher.c (grep_control): Test for EOF before a paragraph
    is processed, not after.  This fixes an unreported bug
    that caused grep-dctrl -sPackage '' output a spurious
    empty Package: line.
  * debian/rules: Added a simple source dependency check.
  * debian/rules: Use -isp with dpkg-gencontrol.

 -- Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <ajk@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Jun 1999 03:21:20 +0300

grep-dctrl (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * buffer.c (buffer_trim): I had ">=" in the loop
    condition, should be "<".  Corrected that; this
    fixes bug #38047.
  * Added debug_messages and asserts all over buffer.c
    while hunting bug #38047.

grep-dctrl (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Got rid of version.h.  The defines are now done on the
    compiler command line.  This will avoid the harmful rebuild of
    grep-dctrl.o in Makefile's install target. Fixes bug#35527.
  * Added the generated manual page to CLEANFILES, so that the
    manpage gets rebuilt.
  * Clean off backup files on debian/rules clean.

    to informational.

    the level `informational' becomes much less verbose.
