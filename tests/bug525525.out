Description: generates random variates with multivariate Lipschitz density
 RanLip generates random variates with an arbitrary multivariate
 Lipschitz density.
 .
 While generation of random numbers from a variety of distributions is
 implemented in many packages (like GSL library
 http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/  and UNURAN library
 http://statistik.wu-wien.ac.at/unuran/), generation of random variate
 with an arbitrary distribution, especially in the multivariate case, is
 a very challenging task. RanLip is a method of generation of random
 variates with arbitrary Lipschitz-continuous densities,  which works in
 the univariate and multivariate cases, if the dimension is not very
 large (say 3-10 variables).
 .
 Lipschitz condition implies that the rate of change of the function (in
 this case, probability density p(x)) is bounded:
 .
 |p(x)-p(y)|<M||x-y||.
 .
 From this condition, we can build an overestimate of the density, so
 called hat function h(x)>=p(x), using a number of values of p(x) at some
 points. The more values we use, the better is the hat function. The
 method of acceptance/rejection then works as follows: generatea  random
 variate X with density h(x); generate an independent uniform on (0,1)
 random number Z; if p(X)<=Z h(X), then return X, otherwise repeat all
 the above steps.
 .
 RanLip constructs a piecewise constant hat function of the required
 density p(x) by subdividing the domain of p (an n-dimensional rectangle)
 into many smaller rectangles, and computes the upper bound on p(x)
 within each of these rectangles, and uses this upper bound as the value
 of the hat function.

Description: C library for parsing and querying a genders database
 Genders is a static cluster configuration database used for cluster
 configuration management.  It is used by a variety of tools and
 scripts for management of large clusters.  The genders database is
 typically replicated on every node of the cluster. It describes the
 layout and configuration of the cluster so that tools and scripts can
 sense the variations of cluster nodes. By abstracting this information
 into a plain text file, it becomes possible to change the
 configuration of a cluster by modifying only one file.

Description: Bean Scripting Framework to support scripting languages in Java
 Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
 scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
 objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs in
 languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. In
 addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or
 dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is
 achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines
 from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to
 these scripting language engines.
 .
 BSF supports these scripting languages:
  * Python (using Jython)
  * JavaScript (using rhino)
  * XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and Xerces)
  * BeanShell (using bsh) via its own bsf adapter

Description: Simple web filtering proxy (GUI)
 BFilter is a filtering web proxy. It was originally intended for removing
 banner ads only, but at some point it has been extended to remove popups and
 webbugs. It can't be used as a general purpose filtering proxy because it
 was never intended this way. For example you can't just block an arbitary
 object, you can only hint the ad detector in its decision making.
 The main advantage BFilter has over the similar tools is its heuristic ad
 detection algorithm. The traditional blocklist-based approach is also
 implemented, but it's mostly used for dealing with false positives. Unlike
 other tools that require constant updates of their blocklists, BFilter
 manages to remove over 90% of ads even with an empty blocklist!
 The javascript generated ads are not a problem for BFilter, as it has a
 javascript engine to combat them.
 .
 BFilter is expected work with any browser that supports proxies (nearly any
 browser does), and can forward requests to another HTTP proxy.

Description: Perl module that facilitates lightweight logging
 In order to have a log we have first to create a Log::LogLite object. The
 Log::LogLite object is created with a logging level. The default logging level
 is 5. After the Log::LogLite object is created, each call to the write method
 may write a new line in the log file. If the level of the message is lower or
 equal to the logging level, the message will be written to the log file. The
 format of the logging messages can be controled by changing the template, and
 by defining a default message. The class uses the IO::LockedFile class.
 .
 The Log::NullLogLite class is derived from the Log::LogLite class and
 implement the Null Object Pattern to let us to use the Log::LogLite class with
 null Log::LogLite objects. We might want to do that if we use a Log::LogLite
 object in our code, and we do not want always to actually define a
 Log::LogLite object (i.e. not always we want to write to a log file). In such
 a case we will create a Log::NullLogLite object instead of the Log::LogLite
 object, and will use that object instead. The object has all the methods that
 the Log::LogLite object has, but those methods do nothing. Thus our code will
 continue to run without any change, yet we will not have to define a log file
 path for the Log::LogLite object, and no log will be created.

Description: Library for Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)
 This library contains functions for evaluating images from a fluid
 flow by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The PIV technique uses
 a sequence of at least two images that are recorded with a well controlled
 separation time in-between. Tracer particles that are resident in the fluid
 may be illuminated by a light source, mostly a laser, that has been
 re-shaped into a sheet of light. In this way, the average
 displacement and the deformation of the image texture is obtained. Applying
 this analyses on small samples of the images on a (rectangular) grid results
 into an instantaneous velocity field of the fluid flow. PIV may also be
 applied for other purposes, like deformations and vibrations of solid
 surfaces. This library includes the core functions for image recording,
 processing, interrogation, PIV data validation, post-processing,
 input/output functions and memory allocation.

Description: Extension of the Perl 5 object system
 Moose, it's the new Camel. Moose is an extension of the existing Perl5
 object system.
 .
 Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, which is a metaclass system for
 Perl5.  This means that Moose not only makes building normal Perl5 objects
 better, but it also provides the power of metaclass programming.
 .
 Moose makes every attempt to provide as much convience during class
 construction/definition, but still stay out of your way if you want it to.
 Here are some of the features Moose provides:
 .
 Unless specified with extends, any class which uses Moose will inherit from
 Moose::Object
 .
 Moose will also manage all attributes (including inherited ones) that are
 defined with has. And assuming that you call new which is inherited from
 Moose::Object, then this includes properly initializing all instance slots,
 setting defaults where approprtiate and performing any type constraint
 checking or coercion.
 .
 For more details, see the ever expanding Moose::Cookbook manpage.

Description: development files for parsing and querying a genders database
 Genders is a static cluster configuration database used for cluster
 configuration management.  It is used by a variety of tools and
 scripts for management of large clusters.  The genders database is
 typically replicated on every node of the cluster. It describes the
 layout and configuration of the cluster so that tools and scripts can
 sense the variations of cluster nodes. By abstracting this information
 into a plain text file, it becomes possible to change the
 configuration of a cluster by modifying only one file.

Description: othello board game for GPE
 Othello is also known as Reversi. gpe-othello is a
 strategic boardgame for the GPE Palmtop Environment
 which involves play against a handheld computer on
 an eight-by-eight square grid with pieces that have
 light and dark faces.
 .
 The player places light-faced pieces so that there is
 at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
 line between the new piece and another light piece, with
 one or more contiguous dark pieces between them. Pieces
 captured in this manner are turned over and can be used
 in later moves. The winner has the most number of pieces
 showing the appropriate face when the grid is full or when
 the other player has no pieces of their own colour left.

Description: interactive full screen 2-way merge tool
 Imediff2 lets you merge two (slightly different) files
 interactively with a user friendly full screen interface
 on a text terminal. In other words, it is an ncurses based
 replacement for sdiff.

 The program shows the differences of given files (in color
 if the terminal supports them), lets you scroll up and down
 and toggle changes between the old and new versions of
 the differing hunks one by one.
 .
 Unlike split screen based merge tools, it shows only one,
 partially merged, version of the file at a time, making
 it more "WYSIWYG", perhaps more intuitive for beginners and
 most importantly, suitable for narrow terminals.

Description: The Debian Almquist Shell
 "dash" is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than "bash".
 We take advantage of that by making it the shell on the installation
 root floppy, where space is at a premium.
 .
 It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
 somewhat faster than "bash"), or as the default shell either of root
 or of a second user with a userid of 0 (because it depends on fewer
 libraries, and is therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade
 problem or a disk failure).  It is also useful for checking that a
 script uses only POSIX syntax.
 .
 "bash" is a better shell for most users, since it has some nice
 features absent from "dash", and is a required part of the system.

Description: barcode and label printing application for KDE
 KBarcode is a barcode and label printing application for KDE. It can be used
 to print everything from simple business cards up to complex labels with
 several barcodes (e.g. article descriptions).
 .
 KBarcode comes with an easy to use WYSIWYG label designer, a setup wizard,
 batch import of data for batch printing labels (directly from the delivery
 note), thousands of predefined labels, database management tools and
 translations in many languages. Even printing more than 10.000 labels in one
 go is no problem for KBarcode. Data for printing can be imported from several
 different data sources, including SQL databases, CSV files and the KDE address
 book.
 .
 Additionally it is a simple barcode generator (similar to the old xbarcode you
 might know). All major types of barcodes like EAN, UPC, CODE39 and ISBN are
 supported. Even complex 2D barcodes are supported using third party tools. The
 generated barcodes can be directly printed or you can export them into images
 to use them in another application.

Description: patch maintenance system for Debian source packages
 dpatch is an easy to use patch system for debian packages, somewhat
 similar to the dbs package, but much simpler to use.
 .
 It lets you store patches and other simple customization templates in
 debian/patches and otherwise does not require much reorganization of
 your source tree. To get the patches applied at build time you simply
 need to include a makefile snippet and then depend on the
 patch/unpatch target in the build or clean stage of debian/rules - or
 you can use the dpatch patching script directly.
 .
 It can easily apply patches only on specific architectures if needed.

Description: Extract distribution name and version from a distribution filename
 Many online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to
 associate multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from
 the filename of the upload. For most distributions this is easy as
 they have used ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the
 distribution, which results in a uniform name. But sadly not all
 uploads are created in this way.
 .
 CPAN::DistnameInfo uses heuristics that have been learnt by
 http://search.cpan.org/ to extract the distribution name and
 version from filenames and also report if the version is to be
 treated as a developer release.

Description: inefficient cvs repository grabber using cvs command
 CVSsuck is a mirroring tool for CVS repositories. Unlike other tools
 such as CVSup or rsync, it uses cvs command to access the repository.
 So, it works well with remote repositories without a special server or
 shell account. However it is inefficient and not perfect because CVS
 client/server protocol is not designed for mirroring. If a server
 provides special way to grab a repository, you shouldn't use CVSsuck.

Description: Picture viewer for X with a thumbnail-based selector
 xzgv is a picture viewer for X, with a thumbnail-based file selector.
 It uses GTK+ and Imlib. Most file formats are supported, and the
 thumbnails used are compatible with xv, zgv, and the Gimp. It can also
 be used with `xzgv file(s)', to effectively bypass the file selector.
 For more on how xzgv works and how to use it, do `info xzgv' or `man
 xzgv' once it's installed.
 .
 xzgv differs from other picture viewers for X in that it uses one
 window for both the file selector and viewer, it (unlike xv) allows
 both scrolling and fit-to-window methods of viewing large pictures,
 and it (unlike xv and some others) doesn't ever mangle the picture's
 aspect ratio.
 .
 It also provides extensive keyboard support; if you prefer using the
 keyboard, this is almost certainly the best viewer for you. But it
 doesn't skimp on the mousey stuff, either.
 .
 Note that this program is written by the author of the svgalib-based
 "zgv", and has similar features.
 .

Description: tools for using algorithms based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
 The seccure toolset implements a selection of asymmetric algorithms
 based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). In particular, it offers
 public key encryption / decryption and signature generation /
 verification. ECC schemes offer a much better key size to security
 ratio than classical systems (RSA, DSA). Keys are short enough to make
 direct specification of keys on the command line possible (sometimes
 this is more convenient than the management of PGP-like key
 rings). seccure builds on this feature and therefore is the tool of
 choice whenever lightweight asymmetric cryptography -- independent of
 key servers, revocation certificates, the Web of Trust, or even
 configuration files -- is required.
 .
 The toolkit implements Diffie-Hellman key exchange, allowing you to agree a
 key with another party over an insecure channel. The Diffie Helman protocol
 affords forward secrecy, and requires no previous contact with the other
 party.
 .
 The seccure toolset allows you to select the curve that the operations are
 performed on, so that different cryptographic needs can be supported. This
 is currently the only ECC package in Debian GNU/Linux to offer a choice of
 curves and MAC lengths.
 .
 It is currently missing some of the functionality of the sks-ecc package,
 including encrypting to multiple recipients at once, and creating different
 signature formats.

Description: Java virtual machine/compiler implemented in .NET (Mono)
 This package provides a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for the .NET and Mono
 runtimes. There are two main ways of using IKVM.NET:
 .
 Dynamically: In this mode, Java classes and jars are used directly to
 execute Java applications on the .NET runtime. Java bytecode is
 translated on the fly into CIL and no further steps are necessary. The
 full Java class loader model is supported in this mode.
 .
 Statically: In order to allow Java code to be used by .NET
 applications, it must be compiled down to a DLL and used directly. The
 bytecode is translated to CIL and stored in this form. The assemblies
 can be referenced directly by the .NET applications and the "Java"
 objects can be used as if they were .NET objects. While the static mode
 does not support the full Java class loader mechanism, it is possible
 for statically-compiled code to create a class loader and load classes
 dynamically.

Description: Nicer names for your Perl modules/classes
 Class names in Perl often don't sound great when spoken, or look good
 when written in prose. For this reason, we tend to say things like
 "customer" or "basket" when we are referring to
 "My::Site::User::Customer" or "My::Site::Shop::Basket". We thought it
 would be nice if our classes knew what we would prefer to call them.

Description: perl data language: Perl extensions for numerics
 gives standard perl the ability to COMPACTLY
 store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large N-dimensional data arrays
 which are the bread and butter of scientific computing.  The idea
 is to turn perl in to a free, array-oriented, numerical language
 in the same sense as commercial packages like IDL and MatLab. One
 can write simple perl expressions to manipulate entire numerical arrays
 all at once. For example, using PDL the perl variable $a can hold a
 1024x1024 floating point image, it only takes 4Mb of memory to store
 it and expressions like $a=sqrt($a)+2 would manipulate the whole image
 in a few seconds.

 A simple interactive shell (perldl) is provided for command line use
 together with a module (PDL) for use in perl scripts.

Description: Carnegie Mellon University's link grammar parser for English
 In Selator, D. and Temperly, D. "Parsing English with a Link Grammar"
 (1991), the authors defined a new formal grammatical system called a
 "link grammar". A sequence of words is in the language of a link
 grammar if there is a way to draw "links" between words in such a way
 that the local requirements of each word are satisfied, the links do
 not cross, and the words form a connected graph. The authors encoded
 English grammar into such a system, and wrote this program to parse
 English using this grammar.
 .
 link-grammar can be used for linguistic parsing for information
 retrieval or extraction from natural language documents. It can also be
 used as a grammar checker.

Description: YAML parser kit -- development files
 Syck is a simple YAML parser kit.
 .
 YAML(tm) (rhymes with 'camel') is a straightforward machine parsable
 data serialization format designed for human readability and
 interaction with scripting languages such as Perl and Python. YAML is
 optimized for data serialization, formatted dumping, configuration
 files, log files, Internet messaging and filtering. This specification
 describes the YAML information model and serialization format. Together
 with the Unicode standard for characters, it provides all the
 information necessary to understand YAML Version 1.0 and construct
 computer programs to process it.
 .
 The whole point of Syck is to make parsing and emitting YAML very
 simple for scripting languages through C bindings.  It doesn't strive
 to be a pull parser or very extendible.  It just is concerned with
 loading a YAML document into a C structure which can be easily
 translated into a scripting language's internal native data type.
 .
 This package contains headers, and the static library to be included in
 your programs or to build bindings from.

Description: A source code documentation tool
 It is difficult to keep documentation in sync with source code. One of the
 reasons is that documentation and source code are stored in separate files
 that usually also require different editors to edit them. ROBODoc solves
 this problem. Specially formatted documentation headers are extracted from
 source files, reformatted in HTML, XML DocBook, TROFF, ASCII, LaTeX, PDF,
 or RTF, and stored in a different file. This way ROBODoc allows you to in
 clude your documentation in the source code. You can edit the source code
 as well as the documentation in a single file with your favourite editor.
 This makes it easier to keep your documentation in sync with your source
 code.
 ROBODoc can be used to document functions, methods, classes, variables,
 makefile entries, system tests, and anything else you can think of.
 .
 ROBODoc works with C, C++, Fortran, Perl, shell scripts, Assembler, DCL,
 DB/C, Tcl/Tk, Forth, Lisp, COBOL, Occam, Basic, HTML, and any other
 language that supports remarks/comments.

 These databases have been compiled in hopes of helping make cyberspace
 a more personable place. With them, software and services can be
 developed to identify persons on the net by face (or, at least, by
 institution logo) instead of by a cryptic e-mail address. Software of
 this kind is for example xfaces and exmh.

 PlayStation 2 development, where one of the texture formats is
 RGBA-palette-based (though not PNG-compressed).
 This is the same technique used for many of the images on the Miscellaneous
 Transparent PNGs page (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngs-img.html), and
 the results are often indistinguishable from the original, truecolor PNG
 images.
 .
 Optimizers (like pngcrush and optipng) optimize the compression, usually
 losslessly, while pngquant quantizes colors down to 256 (or fewer) distinct
 RGBA combinations, which is lossy.

Description: Simple greedy multiple alignment of non-coding DNA sequences
 Sigma ("Simple greedy multiple alignment") is an alignment program with a new
 algorithm and scoring scheme designed specifically for non-coding DNA
 sequence. It uses a strategy of seeking the best possible gapless local
 alignments, at each step making the best possible alignment consistent with
 existing alignments, and scores the significance of the alignment based on the
 lengths of the aligned fragments and a background model which may be supplied
 or estimated from an auxiliary file of intergenic DNA. With real data, while
 "correctness" can't be directly quantified for the alignment, running the
 PhyloGibbs motif finder on pre-aligned sequence suggests that Sigma's
 alignments are superior. It has been published in BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Mar
 16;7:143.

Description: generates random variates with multivariate Lipschitz density
 RanLip generates random variates with an arbitrary multivariate
 Lipschitz density.
 .
 While generation of random numbers from a variety of distributions is
 implemented in many packages (like GSL library
 http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/  and UNURAN library
 http://statistik.wu-wien.ac.at/unuran/), generation of random variate
 with an arbitrary distribution, especially in the multivariate case, is
 a very challenging task. RanLip is a method of generation of random
 variates with arbitrary Lipschitz-continuous densities,  which works in
 the univariate and multivariate cases, if the dimension is not very
 large (say 3-10 variables).
 .
 Lipschitz condition implies that the rate of change of the function (in
 this case, probability density p(x)) is bounded:
 .
 |p(x)-p(y)|<M||x-y||.
 .
 From this condition, we can build an overestimate of the density, so
 called hat function h(x)>=p(x), using a number of values of p(x) at some
 points. The more values we use, the better is the hat function. The
 method of acceptance/rejection then works as follows: generatea  random
 variate X with density h(x); generate an independent uniform on (0,1)
 random number Z; if p(X)<=Z h(X), then return X, otherwise repeat all
 the above steps.
 .
 RanLip constructs a piecewise constant hat function of the required
 density p(x) by subdividing the domain of p (an n-dimensional rectangle)
 into many smaller rectangles, and computes the upper bound on p(x)
 within each of these rectangles, and uses this upper bound as the value
 of the hat function.

Description: Debian Jr. System tools
 This package includes a few tools for helping children learn about and
 use their system.
 .
 Midnight Commander is more than just a file manager.  It is shell with
 which children can explore and manage their own accounts.  It can be a
 great help for the very young, as it saves them some typing (as
 compared with using a command-line shell directly).  It is also packed
 with power and flexibility which can be tapped by older children and
 adults alike.

 Finally, lavaps not only provides a very pleasing way to visualize
 running processes and the resources they use, but can also make
 discovering and killing errant processes an easy thing to do for
 children who lack the ability yet to easily manage "ps" and "kill"
 from the command line.

Description: MMS (e.g. mms://) stream downloader
 MiMMS is a program designed to allow you to download
 streams using the MMS protocol and save them to your
 computer, as opposed to watching them live. Similar
 functionality is available in full media player suites
 such as Xine and MPlayer, but MiMMS is quick and easy
 to use, and for the time being, remains a useful program.
 .
 Originally, MiMMS was forked directly from the last
 known version of mmsclient, which was for years
 unmaintained. MiMMS started with the following goals:
 .
   - Keep a working copy of "mmsclient" (now "MiMMS")
     maintained and working.
   - Fix lots of the bugs that were in mmsclient
   - Eventually extend the functionality of the program

 mmsclient, and actually does all of it's MMS operations
 using libmms, a new library based off of the xine-improved
 mmsclient code, which is designed to allow multiple
 implementations of MMS clients without requiring a fragmented
 code base. At this point, MiMMS is freed from the details of
 the horrendous MMS protocol, and can focus on usability.

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 This module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on top
 of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James
 Clark's expat library.  Each call to one of the parsing methods
 creates a new instance of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to
 parse the document.  Expat options may be provided when the
 XML::Parser object is created.  These options are then passed on to
 the Expat object on each parse call.  They can also be given as extra
 arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or
 Handlers options, or by setHandlers method.  These all provide
 mechanisms for XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by
 XML::Parser::Expat.  If neither Style nor Handlers are specified,
 then parsing just checks the document for being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first
 parameter the Expat object, not the Parser object.

 of a number of sub-kernels, each of which not necessarily working on the same
 domain, where  an optimal sub-kernel weighting can be learned using Multiple
 Kernel Learning.  Apart from SVM 2-class classification and regression
 problems, a number of linear methods like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
 Linear Programming Machine (LPM), (Kernel) Perceptrons and also algorithms to
 train hidden markov models are implemented. The input feature-objects can be
 dense, sparse or strings and of type int/short/double/char and can be
 converted into different feature types. Chains of preprocessors (e.g.
 substracting the mean) can be attached to each feature object allowing for
 on-the-fly pre-processing.

Description: Linux Cross-Reference
 The Linux Cross-Reference project is the testbed application of a
 general hypertext cross-referencing tool.  (Or the other way around.)

 The main goal of the project is to create a versatile
 cross-referencing tool for relatively large code repositories.  The
 project is based on stock web technology, so the codeview client may
 be chosen from the full range of available web browsers.  On the
 server side, any Unix-based web server with cgi-script capability
 should do nicely.
 .
 The main feature of the indexer is of course the ability to jump
 easily to the declaration of any global identifier.  Indeed, even all
 references to global identifiers are indexed.  Quick access to
 function declarations, data (type) definitions and preprocessor macros
 makes code browsing just that tad more convenient.  At-a-glance
 overview of e.g. which code areas that will be affected by changing a
 function or type definition should also come in useful during
 development and debugging.

Description: module for Apache2 which takes the last IP from the 'X-Forwarded-For' header
 rpaf is short for reverse proxy add forward.
 .
 rpaf is for backend Apache servers what mod_proxy_add_forward is for
 frontend Apache servers. It does exactly the opposite of
 mod_proxy_add_forward written by Ask Bjorn Hansen.
 .
 It changes the remote address of the client visible to other Apache modules
 when two conditions are satisfied. First condition is that the remote client
 is actually a proxy that is defined in httpd.conf. Secondly if there is an
 incoming X-Forwarded-For header and the proxy is in its list of known
 proxies it takes the last IP from the incoming X-Forwarded-For header and
 changes the remote address of the client in the request structure.

Description: Virtual Ring Buffer library
 The Virtual Ring Buffer (VRB) is an implementation of a character
 FIFO ring buffer. A ring buffer is a special memory area, because
 writing beyond the end of it actually results in a write at the
 beginning. Such a construct comes very handy in applications where
 one end of a communications channel is required to produce or consume
 data at a constant rate, but the other end cannot gurantee this. This
 is a common situation in multimedia applications or Voice-over-IP
 solutions, for example.
 .
 VRB provides direct access to the buffer so the calling program can
 construct output data in place, or parse input data in place, without
 the extra step of copying data to or from a calling program provided
 buffer area, thus provides a highly efficient ring buffer
 implementation.
 .

Description: GNU R routines for Markov chain Monte Carlo model estimation
 This is a set of routines for GNU R that implement various
 statistical and econometric models using Markov chain Monte Carlo
 (MCMC) estimation, which allows "solving" models that would otherwise
 be intractable with traditional techniques, particularly problems in
 Bayesian statistics (where one or more "priors" are used as part of
 the estimation procedure, instead of an assumption of ignorance about
 the "true" point estimates), although MCMC can also be used to solve
 frequentist statistical problems with uninformative priors.  MCMC
 techniques are also preferable over direct estimation in the presence
 of missing data.
 .
 Currently implemented are a number of ecological inference (EI)
 routines (for estimating individual-level attributes or behavior from
 aggregate data, such as electoral returns or census results), as well
 as models for traditional linear panel and cross-sectional data, some
 visualization routines for EI diagnostics, two item-response theory
 (or ideal-point estimation) models, metric, ordinal, and
 mixed-response factor analysis, and models for Gaussian (linear) and
 Poisson regression, logistic regression (or logit), and binary and
 ordinal-response probit models.
 .
 The suggested packages (r-cran-bayesm, -eco, and -mnp) contain
 additional models that may also be useful for those interested in
 this package.

  - Outputs its level of confidence about the OS on the remote host.
  - Remains usable even if intermediate systems (routers, firewalls) make
    slight modifications to the packets.
  - Can list the type of intermediate device (e.g. "Linux IP masquerading").
  - Modular architecture allows new fingerprinting tests and new OS
    signatures to be added.

Description: Perl extension for using the cfitsio library
 Perl interface to William Pence's cfitsio subroutine library. For more
 information on cfitsio, see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio.
 .
 This module attempts to provide a wrapper for nearly every cfitsio routine,
 while retaining as much cfitsio behavior as possible. As such, one should

Description: web site builder using ReStructured Text as basic content format
 rest2web is a simple tool that lets you build your website from a single
 template (or as many as you want), and keep the contents in ReStructured Text
 (docutils; you can still keep pages in HTML if needed). The prefix "rest"

  * Flexible macro system.
  * Uses relative links, so sites can be viewed from the filesystem.
  * Uses unicode internally.
  * Built-in gallery creator plugin.
 .
 Adding new pages is as easy as dropping a text file into the right folder;
 rest2web builds the new page and adds a link to it in the index (optionally
 with a description as well). Removing a page is just as easy: delete the
 file, and when you run rest2web again it removes the entry.

Description: Popular crossword game, similar to Scrabble(R)
 Scribble is a hybrid of crossword mentality, positional strategy, and
 a true test of your language mastery, similar to the game Scrabble(R)
 by Hasbro.  You start with a board that serves for the placement for
 letter tiles.  On the board there are specific squares that when used
 can add to your score dramatically.  These premium squares can double
 or triple letter values.  Some of these squares can even double or
 triple your word scores!  You must position yourself to grab the
 squares and block your opponent from spelling out a "killer" word.
 .
 This version of Scribble includes a full dictionary, adaptive
 vocabulary, and simple learning.  Lower difficulty levels give the
 computer fewer words to choose from but if you use a word that the
 computer wouldn't have, it's fair game from that point forward.  At
 maximum difficulty, the computer will play about a 750 point game.
 .
 This package is not for beginners as the display does not include
 letter values or a description of what the symbols on the board
 represent.  You must be familiar with the game of Scrabble(R) before
 trying to play this game.

 off the enemy's armies via bombardment, and then beaming
 your team's armies down. When all the planets have been
 taken, the game ends, a new game begins, and the player
 who actually took the last planet gets his/her name up
 in lights.

Description: Abstract base class for Class::DBI plugins
 The purpose of this module is to make writing Class::DBI plugins
 easier. Writers of plugins should be able to concentrate on the
 functionality that their module provides, instead of having to deal with
 the symbol table hackery involved when writing a plugin module.
 .
 Class::DBI provides a convenient abstraction layer to a database. It
 not only provides a simple database to object mapping layer, but can
 be used to implement several higher order database functions, at the
 application level, rather than at the database.

Description: scripts for dynamic IP to name mappings
 GnuDIP is a service designed for an ISP to give its customers a static DNS
 name without having to give them their own IP address. For those who are
 familiar with ml.org this is a simple replacement.
 .
 GnuDIP has two main parts on the server side. 1, the multi-threaded
 server that listens on a port 3495 that accepts connections from client
 applications and updates their hostname, and 2 the web cgi that is used
 as the administration tool and as the users tool to manage their own
 account.
 .
 Using the web cgi a user can set their desired homepage in their settings
 and then set the special URL as the default page for their browser so now
 every time they open their browser their hostname will be automatically
 updated without having to run any other sort of client application and then
 they would be redirected to the URL they set in their GnuDIP settings.

Description: GreyList milter for sendmail
 milter-greylist is a stand-alone milter written in C that implements the
 greylist filtering method, as proposed by Evan Harris.
 .
 Grey listing works by assuming that unlike legitimate MTA, spam engines will
 not retry sending their junk mail on a temporary error. The filter will
 always temporarily reject mail on a first attempt, and to accept it after
 some time has elapsed.
 .
 If spammers ever try to resend rejected messages, we can assume they will not
 stay idle between the two sends (if they do, the spam problem would just be
 solved). Odds are good that the spammer will send a mail to an honey pot
 address and get blacklisted in several real-time distributed black list
 before the second attempt.

Description: Credential Validation Modules
 CVM is a framework for validating a set of credentials against a database
 using a filter program.  The modules act as a filter, taking a set of
 credentials as input and writing a set of facts as output if those
 credentials are valid.  Optional input is given to the module through
 environment variables.
 .
 Some of the ideas for CVM came from experience with PAM (pluggable
 authentication modules), the checkpassword interface used by qmail-pop3d,
 and the "authmod" interface used by Courier IMAP and POP3.  This framework
 places fewer restrictions on the invoking client than checkpassword does,
 and is much simpler to implement on both sides than PAM and the authmod
 framework.
 .
 See http://untroubled.org/cvm/cvm.html for more information.

Description: Haskell library for building Internet applications
 HAppS is a Haskell library for building industrial strength Internet
 applications safely, quickly, and easily. With HAppS you focus
 entirely on application functionality implemented in Haskell and you
 don't have to worry about making sure all sorts of server subsystems
 are functioning properly.
 .
  - HTTP Application Server
    Performs better than Apache/PHP in our informal benchmarks
    (thanks to FastPackedString), handles serving both large (video)
    files and lazy (javascript) streaming, supports HTTP-Auth, and more.
  - Mail delivery agent with integrated DNS resolver
    Stop worrying about making sure a separate local mail server or DNS is
    up and running to delivery your mail. HAppS takes care of making sure
    your mail is delivered as long as your application itself is running
    and makes sure no outbound mail is lost even with unplanned restarts.
  - XML and XSLT
    Separate application logic from presentation using XML/XSLT. With
    HAppS, you can have your application output XML (via HTTP or SMTP) and
    handle style/presentation via separate XSLT files at runtime. HAppS
    takes care of doing server side XSLT for outbound mail and HTTP
    user-agents that don't support it client side.
  - SMTP Server
    Handle incoming email in your application without worrying about
    .procmail or other user level inbound mail configuration hackery. Just
    have the HAppS.SMTP listen on port 25 or have the system mail server
    SMTP forward mail for your app to some internal port.
  - Monadic ACID transaction service
    Write apps as a set of simple state transformers. MACID write-ahead
    logging and checkpointing make it easy for you to guarantee
    application integrity in the face of unplanned outages. MACID even
    guarantees that your side effects will be executed at-least-once if
    they can complete within a timelimit you define.
  - Session Service
    Define bits of per-user application state that automatically expire
    after time limits you define. No more manual housekeeping of session
    data!
  - (Experimental) Table and Index
    Do relational operations safely on in memory Haskell Data.Set(s)
    rather than dealing with an external SQL relational database. Define
    custom indices for your Haskell datatypes (e.g. geographic/geometric
    types). Use in combination with MACID for a robust relational DBMS
    customized for your application.

Description: Update Class::DBI data using CGI::Untaint
 Lots of times, Class::DBI is used in web-based applications. (In
 fact, coupled with a templating system that allows you to pass
 objects, such as Template::Toolkit, Class::DBI is very much your
 friend for these.)
 .
 And, as we all know, one of the most irritating things about writing
 web-based applications is the monotony of writing much of the same
 stuff over and over again. And, where there's monotony there's a
 tendency to skip over stuff that we all know is really important, but
 is a pain to write - like Taint Checking and sensible input
 validation. (Especially as we can still show a 'working' application
 without it!). So, we now have CGI::Untaint to take care of a lot of
 that for us.
 .
 It so happens that CGI::Untaint also plays well with Class::DBI. All
 you need to do is to 'use Class::DBI::FromCGI' in your class (or in
 your local Class::DBI subclass that all your other classes inherit
 from. You do do that, don't you?).

Description: library for accessing the Irman Infra Red hardware
 libirman is a library that allows access to Irman Infra Red hardware from
 Linux and other Unix systems.
 .
 For general application programming, the preferred interface for infra-red
 control is `lirc', as lirc supports multiple programs sharing the same
 infra-red receiver.  It does this by providing a socket based interface to
 which several programs can connect.
 .
 lirc uses libirman to interface with the Irman Infra Red hardware, so in
 single use applications directly using libirman is simpler and uses less
 system resources.  Currently, lirc only works on Linux systems, so programs
 written using libirman directly are more portable.
 .
 NOTE: This debian package is mainly provided so that Irman support can be
 enabled in lirc package and there is no libirman0 because upstream doesn't
 build a shared library.

Description: a mail notification tool
 biff is a small program that prints a message to your terminal
 when new email arrives. Actually, the message is printed by
 the comsat daemon, and biff just enables/disables the u+x
 permission flag for the terminal, which comsat uses to determine
 whether or not to write to your terminal.
 .
 biff is mainly of historic interest, since there are much better
 alternatives (xbiff, gbiff) that are network-aware and do not
 require a daemon. Although there are no known security problems,
 running additional services is often considered risky.
 .
 By default, the biff service is disabled. To use biff email
 notification, you must enable this service by running 'update-inetd
 --enable biff' after the package is installed. You may also need
 to modify the configuration of your mail transport agent to enable
 comsat notification.

 algorithm, it's easiest to look at these examples:
 .
  1.1   <  1.2
  1.1a  <  1.2
  1.1   <  1.1.1
  1.1   <  1.1a
  1.1.a <  1.1a
  1     <  a
  a     <  b
  1     <  2
 .
  (special handling for leading zeros)
  0002  <  1
  1.06  <  1.5
 .
  (a hyphen binds looser than a period)
  1-1 < 1-2
  1-2 < 1.2

Description: Spiffy Perl Interface Framework For You
 "Spiffy" is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented (OO)
 programming in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm,
 base.pm, mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation class. It
 attempts to fix all the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO, in a
 clean, straightforward and (perhaps someday) standard way.
 .
 Spiffy borrows ideas from other OO languages like Python, Ruby,
 Java and Perl 6. It also adds a few tricks of its own.
 .
 If you take a look on CPAN, there are a ton of OO related modules. When
 starting a new project, you need to pick the set of modules that makes
 most sense, and then you need to use those modules in each of your
 classes. Spiffy, on the other hand, has everything you'll probably need
 in one module, and you only need to use it once in one of your classes.
 If you make Spiffy.pm the base class of the basest class in your
 project, Spiffy will automatically pass all of its magic to all of your
 subclasses. You may eventually forget that you're even using it!

Description: Rip and encode CDs with one command
 Jack has been developed with one main goal: making OGGs (or MP3s)
 without having to worry. There is nearly no way that an incomplete rip
 goes unnoticed, e.g. jack compares WAV and OGG file sizes when
 continuing from a previous run. Jack also checks your HD space before
 doing anything (even keeps some MB free).
 .
 Jack is different from other such tools in a number of ways:
  - it supports different rippers and encoders
  - it is very configurable
  - it doesn't need X
  - it can "rip" virtual CD images like the ones created by cdrdao
  - when using cdparanoia, cdparanoia's status information is displayed
    and archived for all tracks, so you can see if something went wrong
  - it uses sophisticated disk space management, i.e. it schedules its
    ripping/encoding processes depending on available space.
  - freedb query, file renaming and id3/ogg-tagging
  - it can resume work after it has been interrupted. If all tracks have
    been ripped, it doesn't even need the CD anymore, even if you want
    to do a freedb query.
  - it can do a freedb query based on OGGs alone, like if you don't
    remember from which CD those OGGs came from.
  - freedb submissions

   can be extracted from the file, like file length and the local filename.
 * It launches your web browser to do a lookup at our website, submitting
   this identifying information as the search terms.
 .
 At bitzi.com you'll see what - if anything - others have said about your
 file, and have a chance to contribute descriptions or comments yourself.
 If your automatic submission included information useful to our database,
 that new information will be contributed to the database under your screen
 name.

Description: C/C++ literate programming system (Marc van Leeuwen's version)
 This version is a complete rewrite of Levy & Knuth's version of CWEB.
 It uses a slightly different syntax from the L&K version, but provides a
 compatibility mode allowing L&K CWEB sources to be processed, producing
 similar (though not necessarily identical) output.
 .
 CWEB allows you to write documents which can be used simultaneously as
 C/C++ programs and as TeX documentation for them.
 .
 The philosophy behind CWEB is that programmers who want to provide the best
 possible documentation for their programs need two things simultaneously: a
 language like TeX for formatting, and a language like C for programming.
 Neither type of language can provide the best documentation by itself.  But
 when both are appropriately combined, we obtain a system that is much more
 useful than either language separately.

Description: spreadsheet-like graphical image manipulation tool
 nip2 is a graphical front end to the VIPS package.
 .
 VIPS is an image processing system designed with efficiency in mind.
 It is good with large images (images larger than the amount of RAM in
 your machine), and for working with colour.  It can perform many
 image manipulation tasks much faster than other packages such as
 ImageMagick and the GIMP and includes some special features such as
 creating single "mosaic" images from multiple parts.
 .
 VIPS consists of two main components: an image processing library
 with some command-line tools and a spreadsheet-like graphical user
 interface.  This package supplies the graphical interface.
 .
 With nip2, rather than directly editing images, you build
 relationships between objects in a spreadsheet-like fashion.  When
 you make a change somewhere, nip2 recalculates the objects affected by
 that change.  Since it is demand-driven this update is very fast,
 even for very, very large images.  nip2 is very good at creating
 pipelines of image manipulation operations.  It is not very good for
 image editing tasks like touching up photographs.  For that, a tool
 like the GIMP should be used instead.

 layers, and it shows for every active process the CPU utilization in system
 and user mode, the virtual and resident memory growth, priority, username,
 state, and exit code. The process level activity is also shown for processes
 which finished during the last interval, to get a complete overview about the
 consumers of things such as CPU time.

 train hidden markov models are implemented. The input feature-objects can be
 dense, sparse or strings and of type int/short/double/char and can be
 converted into different feature types. Chains of preprocessors (e.g.
 substracting the mean) can be attached to each feature object allowing for
 on-the-fly pre-processing.

Description: Virtual Ring Buffer library - shell interface
 The Virtual Ring Buffer (VRB) is an implementation of a character
 FIFO ring buffer. A ring buffer is a special memory area, because
 writing beyond the end of it actually results in a write at the
 beginning. Such a construct comes very handy in applications where
 one end of a communications channel is required to produce or consume
 data at a constant rate, but the other end cannot gurantee this. This
 is a common situation in multimedia applications or Voice-over-IP
 solutions, for example.
 .
 VRB provides direct access to the buffer so the calling program can
 construct output data in place, or parse input data in place, without
 the extra step of copying data to or from a calling program provided
 buffer area, thus provides a highly efficient ring buffer
 implementation.
 .
 This package contains the program vbuf, which implements nothing but
 a simple ring buffer, so it can be used directly from the shell.

 which should be automatically loaded as needed by the hotplug
 system. It also provides a small loader utility which can be used to
 accomplish the same thing when hotplug is not in use.

 the text in your browser, they print at the full resolution of your
 printer, and you don't have to wait for dozens of images to be
 downloaded in order to see the mathematics in a web page.

 Other interesting feature is the automatic calculation of copies,
 enabling only the writers requested to complete the number and
 skipping all that are disabled.
 .
 The CDcontrol interface is very simple and dialog based, simple type
 "cdcontrol" and enjoy.

Description: Simple spam-block with refusal message
 Smtp-refuser can be configured to reject mail from specific hosts
 (or that satisfy other tcpd hosts.allow or similar rules), returning a
 meaningful message including the reason it was bounced and a local phone
 number.  Because spam often has a bad envelope-from, (and because this
 is more efficient), we bounce it with an error message during the
 SMTP transaction, rather than send bounce mail later.
 .
 This SMTP refuser is used along with "tcpd" or (another TCP security
 daemon) to bounce messages from the IP addresses of known spammers. The
 advantage of this over just blocking the connection is that the remote
 SMTP server will not retry, and a legitimate e-mail sender will get a
 polite message telling them why their mail was blocked and whom to call
 to get around the blocking.
 .
 Mail that is not blocked by smtp-refuser is delivered to your standard
 mail transport agent.
 .
 Other, more automated solutions such as RBL and ORBS (supported by
 most of the mail transfer agents), have become available since
 smtp-refuser was written, but this may still be of interest to you.

 This package provides INN 2.x, which is a very complex news server
 daemon useful for big sites. The 'inn' package still exists for smaller
 sites which do not need the complexity of INN 2.x.

 The news transport is the part of the system that stores the articles
 and the lists of which groups are available and so on, and provides
 those articles on request to users. It receives news (either posted
 locally or from a newsfeed site), files it, and passes it on to any
 downstream sites. Each article is kept for a period of time and then
 deleted (this is known as 'expiry').
 .
 By default Debian's INN will install in a fairly simple 'local-only'
 configuration.
 .
 In order to make use of the services provided by INN you'll have to
 use a user-level newsreader program such as trn. The newsreader is
 the program that fetches articles from the server and shows them to
 the user, remembering which the user has seen so that they don't get
 shown again. It also provides the posting interface for the user.

 into account the possibility of adding new ways of querying to the
 framework. The communication protocol for client-server communication,
 MRML, is XML based and fully documented (http://www.mrml.net). This
 aims at promoting code reuse among researchers and application
 developers.

Description: library for dealing with Microsoft CHM format files
 It is a very simple library, but sufficient for dealing with all of the
 chm files. Library currently does not has write support.
 .
 CHM files are used on the Micosoft Windows platform to store program
 documentation, almost always in the form of HTML, with some non-standard
 quirks. CHM files are a form of archive known as InfoTech Storage Format
 (ITSF) files and contain some special files to implement features of the
 CHM viewer. On Windows they are accessed through a kind of virtual
 filesystem exposed by a dynamically loaded library. ITSF files have
 UTF-8 filenames and use an LZX cruncher to compress all the files in one
 big chunk. Both the ITSF and the formats of the internal CHM files are
 highly indexed and their designs are all clearly optimized for read-only
 access.

Description: convert DocBook SGML source into HTML using DSSSL
 A text-formatting package based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
 Language), which allows you to produce TeX/DVI/PS/PDF, HTML, RTF, and
 plain ASCII (currently via w3m by default) from a single source with
 other recommended and suggested packages; due to the flexible nature
 of SGML, many other target formats are possible.
 .
 This tool can not handle DocBook XML yet.  For DocBook SGML only.
 .
 HTML can be generated without any other Debian text processing package,
 but for the other formats the appropriate packages have to be installed.
 You need to install lynx or w3m for ASCII text output (w3m is the default
 txt backend).  Also jadetex is required for PS and PDF, and
 linuxdoc-tools for ld2db conversion.
 .
 This system is tailored for writing technical software documentation,
 an example of which are the Linux HOWTO documents.  However, there is
 nothing Linux-specific about this package; it can be used for many
 other types of documentation on many other systems.  It should be
 useful for all kinds of printed and online documentation.
 .
 The package was formerly called linuxdoc-sgml because it originates
 from the Linux Documentation Project (LDP).  The name has been changed
 into sgmltools to make it clearer that there is no Linux-specific
 stuff included in this package.
 .
 This is the latest version of the sgmltools series and the successor of
 sgmltools v2.

Description: Lightweight, "relaxed" RSS (and XML-ish) parser
 XML::RSSLite attempts to extract the maximum amount of content from
 available documents, and is less concerned with XML compliance than
 alternatives. Rather than rely on XML::Parser, it uses heuristics and good
 old-fashioned Perl regular expressions. It stores the data in a simple
 hash structure, and "aliases" certain tags so that when done, you can
 count on having the minimal data necessary for re-constructing a valid
 RSS file. This means you get the basic title, description, and link for a
 channel and its items.
 .
 This module extracts more usable links by parsing "scriptingNews" and
 "weblog" formats in addition to RDF & RSS. It also "sanitizes" the
 output for best results.

 The Debian package of hpijs includes the so-called rss patch, to use
 pure black ink instead of composite black in printers that don't do
 color map conversion in firmware.
 .
 HPIJS can take advantage of Ghostscript IJS KRGB support when
 available, to enhance black printing on printers that do color
 map conversion in firmware and are thus not affected by the old
 rss patch.
 .
 Users of the CUPS printing system are advised to also install the
 hplip package, and use the hp CUPS backend to send data to the printer.
 HPLIP supports USB, networked and parallel-port devices, and enables
 extended HPIJS functionality such as border-less printing.
 Selecting any hpijs ppd in CUPS will use hpijs automatically.
 .
 Users of spoolers other than CUPS with printers connected through USB or
 parallel ports are advised to install the hpoj package.  Extended HPIJS
 functionality will not be available.
 .
 HPIJS is meant to be used through the foomatic system (see the
 foomatic-filters package).

Description: tool for optimizing PNG (Portable Network Graphics) images
 Pngnq is a tool for quantizing 32-bit RGBA PNG images to 8-bit RGBA pallete
 PNG. It's is an adaptation by Stuart Coyle of Greg Roelf's pnqquant. While
 pngquant uses a median cut algorithm, Pngnq uses Anthony Dekker's neuquant
 algorithm (http://members.ozemail.com.au/~dekker/NEUQUANT.HTML), generally
 resulting in better looking results than pngquant.
 .
 Optimizers (like pngcrush and optipng) optimize the compression, usually
 losslessly. pngnq quantizes colors down to 256 (or fewer) distinct RGBA
 combinations, which is quite lossy. Optimized PNGs are usually two to four
 times smaller than the 32-bit versions.

 type of tree as the "EasyTree" style added to XML::Parser by
 XML::Parser::EasyTree.  XML::Handler::TreeBuilder builds the same
 type of tree as Sean M. Burke's XML::TreeBuilder.  These classes make
 it possible to construct these tree structures from sources other
 than XML::Parser.
 .
 All three handlers can be driven by either PerlSAX 1 or PerlSAX 2
 drivers.  In all cases, the end_document() method returns a reference
 to the constructed tree, which normally becomes the return value of
 the PerlSAX driver.

Description: A single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation game.
 Angband is a single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation derived
 from the game Moria, which was in turn based on Rogue. It is
 often described as a "roguelike" game because the look and feel of
 the game is still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 Angband features many enhancements over Moria: unique foes, artifacts,
 monster pits and vaults to name a few. Many of these new creatures
 and objects are drawn from the writings of J.R.R Tolkien, although
 some of the monsters come straight from classical mythology, Dungeons
 & Dragons, Rolemaster, or the minds of the original Angband coders.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so,
 you will receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may
 retire.
 .
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's "prison of iron."
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R.
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth.

Description: Update Configuration File: preserves user changes to config files.
 Debian policy states that configuration files must preserve user
 changes during package upgrade.  The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a `conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it.  This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile like handling for files that
 can not be labelled conffiles, are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead.  This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for "conffiles".
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided conffile like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 install time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: ext2, minix and xiafs filesystem defragmenter
 As a file system is used, data tends to become more and more
 scattered across the disk, degrading performance.  A disk
 defragmenter simply re-organises the data on the disk, so that
 individual files occupy a single sequential set of disk blocks,
 and all the free space on the disk is collected together in a
 single region. This generally means that reading a whole file
 is faster, and disk accesses in general are more efficient.

  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: hyperfast and lightweight templating for the Python platform
 Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar, non-XML
 syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance. Mako's
 syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others, including Django
 templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded
 Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of
 componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most
 straightforward and flexible models available, while also maintaining close
 ties to Python calling and scoping semantics.

 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, taper, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.

 nzb files are a popular way to describe files posted on Usenet which span
 several messages (multi-part binaries). These files eliminate the need to
 fetch headers from newsgroups as nzb files contain the message-ids of the
 segments which can be downloaded directly from most news servers. A technical
 description can be found at http://docs.newzbin.com/Newzbin:NZB_Specs
 .
 nzb makes Usenet downloading easy by providing an easy to use interface which
 loads up a specified nzb file and either downloads the files described in the
 nzb or streams the data to an external application. This is usually used for
 video files which results in streaming video over Usenet.

Description: A (syntax-)tree-handling tool (term processor)
 Kimwitu++ is a system that supports the construction of programs that use
 trees or terms as their main data structure.  It allows you to define, store
 and operate on trees with typed nodes. Each type of node has a specific number
 of sons, and expects these sons to have specific types.  The most popular
 example of such trees are syntax trees.
 .
 The nodes are defined in a Yacc-like fashion.  The tree can be unparsed (ie.
 treewalk) and rewritten (ie. term substitution). Kimwitu++ gives you powerful
 pattern matching for specifying unparse and rewrite rules.
 .
 Kimwitu++ is an extension to C++. It introduces Yacc-like node definitions,
 the unparse and rewrite rules, and extensions for pattern matching within
 functions. It will translate its input files into pure C++.
 .
 To build the tree you might use a parser generated with Bison, but you are
 free to use other tools.  There also exists Kimwitu (also packaged for Debian)
 which interfaces with C instead of C++ which can also be used in C++ projects,
 but Kimwitu++ has some extensions one might consider useful.

 set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using
 automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references,
 citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures
 and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting
 information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes,
 paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted
 appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as
 mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images
 which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final
 HTML document.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and
 symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also
 allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw
 HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as
 new commands and environments from within a LaTeX document.

Description: Development files to do S/Ident authentication
 S/Ident is a modified version of the standard ident protocol that adds
 SASL-based authentication.  libsident is a requester implementation, used
 to send S/Ident queries to a remote system that has connected to a local
 service.  Currently, only Kerberos v4 and Kerberos v5 GSS-API

 access to an appropriate srvtab or keytab.  In a pinch, this library can
 also be used to send normal ident queries, but there are better libraries
 for that.
 .
 This package contains the symlinks, headers, and static library needed to
 compile and link programs that use libsident.

Description: Easier relationship specification in Class::DBI::Loader
 This module acts as a mix-in, adding the relationship() method to
 Class::DBI::Loader. Since Class::DBI::Loader knows how to map between
 table names and class names, there ought to be no need to replicate
 the names.
 .
 In addition, it is common (but not universal) to want reverse
 relationships defined for has-many relationships, and for has-a
 relationships to be defined for the linkages surrounding a
 many-to-many table.
 .
 The aim of this module is to simplify the declaration of common
 database relationships by providing both of these features.
 .
 The relationship takes a string. It recognises table names (singular
 or plural, for convenience) and extracts them from the "sentence".

Description: Graham Stoney's mechanized man page generator.
 Please do not use c2man -- it is unmaintained upstream now, and only
 exists because other packages depend on it.  Doxygen does a far better
 job.
 .
 C2man is an automatic documentation tool that extracts comments from C
 source code to generate functional interface documentation in the same
 format as sections 2 & 3 of the Unix Programmer's Manual. It requires
 minimal effort from the programmer by looking for comments in the
 usual places near the objects they document, rather than imposing a
 rigid function-comment syntax or requiring that the programmer learn
 and use a typesetting language.  Acceptable documentation can often be
 generated from existing code with no modifications.
 .
 conformance: supports both K&R and ISO/ANSI C coding styles -- but it
 has problems with variable names of type __somename.
 .
 Features:
  * generates output in nroff -man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or
    HTML format
  * handles comments as part of the language grammar
  * automagically documents enum parameter & return
    values
  * handles C (/* */) and C++ (//) style comments
 Problems:
  * doesn't handle C++ grammar (yet)
  * doxygen does this job better

Description: client-side implementation of the rsync algorithm
 zsync is a file transfer program to download files from
 remote web servers. If a previous version of a file is available
 locally, zsync will only download changed parts and hereby
 minimise the download volume. The algorithm is the same as used
 by rsync(1), but zsync does not require any server software
 (apart from a web server), nor does it need shell access.
 Instead, it uses a control file (.zsync file) that describes the
 file to be downloaded, which it uses to determine the blocks to
 fetch. This file is created once on the server (and not for each
 request) and sits next to actual file to download

Description: IPSec utilities for strongSwan
 IPSec is Internet Protocol SECurity. It uses strong cryptography to provide
 both authentication and encryption services. Authentication ensures that
 packets are from the right sender and have not been altered in transit.
 Encryption prevents unauthorised reading of packet contents.
 .
 This version of strongSwan supports Opportunistic Encryption (OE) out of the
 box. OE enables you to set up IPSec tunnels to a site without
 co-ordinating with the site administrator, and without hand
 configuring each tunnel. If enough sites support OE, a "FAX effect"
 occurs, and many of us can communicate without eavesdroppers.
 .
 In addition to OE, you may manually configure secure tunnels through
 untrusted networks. Everything passing through the untrusted net is
 encrypted by the IPSec gateway machine and decrypted by the gateway
 at the other end. The result is Virtual Private Network or VPN. This
 is a network which is effectively private even though it includes
 machines at several different sites connected by the insecure Internet.
 .
 Please note that you will need a recent kernel (>=2.4.24 or 2.6.x)
 for using this package. The standard Debian kernel includes both IPSec
 and crypto support, patching the kernel is no longer necessary!
 .
 If you want to use the KLIPS IPSec code for kernel modules instead of the
 native ones, you will need to install either openswan-modules-source or
 linux-patch-openswan and build the respective modules for your kernel.

 never (or not yet) used?  In interactive programs, postponed realization
 may boost start-up: the realization of objects is triggered by the
 use, so spread over time.

Description: Amazons boardgame for Gnome
 Amazons is a game played on a 10x10 chess board. Each side has four pieces
 (amazons) that move like chess queens (in a straight line in any direction).
 Instead of capturing pieces like in chess, the game is determined based on who
 moves last.
 .
 Each move consists of two parts. First an amazon moves to a new square and
 then fires an arrow to another square (the arrow is fired in a straight line
 in any direction from the square the amazon landed on). The square the arrow
 lands on becomes a permenant block for the rest of the game. No one can move
 over it, or fire an arrow over it. Every turn an amazon must move and fire an
 arrow, so every turn there is one less square available on the board. Try and
 block in your opponent or section off a good chunk of the board for yourself.
