Description: 3D chess for X11
 3 dimensional Chess game for X11R6.  There are three boards, stacked
 vertically; 96 pieces of which most are the traditional chess pieces with
 just a couple of additions; 26 possible directions in which to move.  The
 AI isn't wonderful, but provides a challenging enough game to all but the
 most highly skilled players.

Description: "Three-dimensional" desktop switcher
 3D-Desktop is an OpenGL program for switching virtual desktops in
 a seamless 3-dimensional manner.  The current desktop is mapped into a
 fullscreen 3D environment where you may choose other screens.  Several
 different visualization modes are available.  A window manager
 compatible with the GNOME pager standard is required.
 .
 The transition from working desktop to fullscreen 3D environment is
 seamless: when the pager activates you see your current desktop appear
 to zoom out to a point in space where you can see your other virtual
 desktops allowing you to select another.
 .
 The program is rather memory-hungry and it is CPU intensive, but it's
 accessible from the command line, which makes it perfect for show
 floors and impressing your non-UN*X-using friends.

Description: resolution modification tool for Intel graphic chipset
 915resolution is a tool to modify the video BIOS of the 800
 and 900 series Intel graphics chipsets. This includes the 845G,
 855G, and 865G chipsets, as well as 915G, 915GM, and 945G chipsets.
 This modification is necessary to allow the display of certain
 graphics resolutions for an Xorg or XFree86 graphics server.
 .
 915resolution's modifications of the BIOS are transient.
 There is no risk of permanent modification of the BIOS.
 This also means that 915resolution must be run every time the
 computer boots in order for its changes to take effect.
 If you want to automatically set the resolution on each boot
 and before X is launched, see /usr/share/doc/915resolution/README.Debian
 for information about configuring the provided initscript.

Description: GNU a2ps - 'Anything to PostScript' converter and pretty-printer
 GNU a2ps converts files into PostScript for printing or viewing. It uses a
 nice default format, usually two pages on each physical page, borders
 surrounding pages, headers with useful information (page number, printing
 date, file name or supplied header), line numbering, symbol substitution
 as well as pretty printing for a wide range of programming languages.
 .
 Historically, a2ps started as a text to PostScript converter, but thanks
 to powerful delegations it is able to let you use it for any kind of files,
 ie it can also digest manual pages, dvi files, texinfo, ....
 .
 Among the other most noticeable features of a2ps are:
  - various encodings (all the Latins and others),
  - various fonts (automatic font down loading),
  - various medias,
  - various printer interfaces,
  - various output styles,
  - various programming languages,
  - various helping applications,
  - and various spoken languages.

Description: Translates ABC music description files to PostScript
 This is the Debian port of the abcm2ps program by Jean-François Moine.
 The program translates tunes written in the ABC format to PostScript,
 which can then be viewed using Ghostview et al. or printed on a
 PostScript printer or through Ghostscript. It supports various
 semi-standard extensions to the ABC standard, such as multiple
 voices and staves.
 .
 This program is a vastly improved spin-off from Michael Methfessel's
 abc2ps, which continues to be available for the time being. In particular,
 it contains a lot of extensions to help typeset classical music.

Description: converter from ABC to MIDI format and back
 This package contains the programs `abc2midi' and `midi2abc',  which
 convert from the abc musical notation format to standard MIDI format
 and vice-versa. They can generate accompaniment from guitar chords
 in the abc file, as well as insert various MIDI events; the
 MIDI-to-abc translation tries to figure out bars, triplets and
 accidentals on its own.
 .
 The package also contains `abc2abc' (an abc prettyprinter/transposer),
 `mftext' (a program that dumps a MIDI file as text), and `midicopy'
 (a program that extracts specific tracks, channels or time intervals
 from a MIDI file).
 .
 The programs in this package are based on the `midifilelib'
 distribution available from http://www.harmony-central.com/MIDI/.

Description: yet another ABC to PostScript converter
 This program translates tunes written in the ABC format to PostScript,
 which can then be viewed on screen or printed. It is essentially a
 (non-exclusive) alternative to abc2ps, being based on the abc2ps
 PostScript code together with the ABC parser from the abcmidi package.
 .
 People interested in this kind of software should also check out the
 abcm2ps package, which contains a similar program that has lots of
 additional features.

Description: WYSIWYG word processor based on GTK2
 AbiWord is the first application of a complete, open source office
 suite. The upstream source includes cross-platform support for Win32,
 BeOS, and QNX as well as GTK+ on Unix.
 .
 AbiWord is still being developed. It's quite usable but not yet full-
 featured or polished. For many applications, however, it should prove
 effective and efficient.
 .
 This program includes support for reading Microsoft Word files,
 RTF files, and many other foreign file formats. Natively, it uses a
 custom XML-based file format.
